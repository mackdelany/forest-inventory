# Mack Delany and his forests

Howdy and thanks for stopping by!

This repository provides a webservice showcasing my favorite forests (and a few other places with trees).

## Getting started

To run the service pull the repositary to a local machine and run:

```
docker-compose up
```

## What I'd do differently with more time

- postgres
- cloud stuff
- permissions/auth on db
- add a sort to forest db thing
- revisit health metrics data type
- get brand colors
- look at postgres
- permissions on db
- favicon / logos / brand colors
- cloud
